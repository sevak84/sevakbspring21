### What is a .pcap file? 
Pcap stands for packet capture and is a file extension which mainly associated with Wireshark to analyze networks. Basically it is being used to trace network paths, traffic, and ip packets. Recorded data packets that has been pulled out from network are being saved in “.pcap” extension file format. The “.pcap” file extension and can be used to find performance problems and cyberattacks on the network. The pcap file creates a record of network data that we can view through Wireshark.


### What is the tool tcpreplay and how does it work?
The tcpreplay is a tool that we can use to replaying previously captured network traffic from files saved with tcpdump or other tools which write pcap files. It is designed to replay malicious patterns to intrusion detection/prevention systems, it has seen many evolutions including capabilities to replay to web servers. The basic operation of tcpreplay is to resend all packets from the input file(s) at the speed at which they were recorded, or a specified data rate, up to as fast as the hardware is capable.
Optionally, the traffic can be split between two interfaces, written to files, filtered and edited in various ways, providing the means to test firewalls, NIDS and other network devices.
