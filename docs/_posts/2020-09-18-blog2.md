# How to install Docker? What does Docker do? 

The docker is a software package that creates a container for the application development. So for this lab exercise we need to install the Docker on our Ubuntu machine.  
First of all we need to get the latest updaes for our machine with typing this command "sudo apt-get update then if we have any old version of the docker we should remove that then install new version so for that reason we need to type this command "sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io" after this tep finished we can move forward and install the docker on our Ubuntu machine wit this command "sudo apt install docker.io"

# Next step: Install a text editor for example VIM or Nano

On the ubuntu machine run the terminal and type this command and run "sudo apt-get install nano" 


# And we need a web server to show the result: 

So I am going to install Apache web server again through ubuntu terminal "sudo apt-get install apache2". To make sure that we have the latest version of the Apache we run the "apache2 -v" then we can start the apache service with typing this caommand "service apache2 start". So we can type locolhost(127.0.0.1) with 8080 port number on the browser to see if apache is responding or not. 


Next we should install mysql with this command "sudo apt-get install -y mysql-client" 

then we need to install PHP for our webserver with this command "sudo apt-get install php" and next we need to create file named info.php to be able for shwing on our webserver. 

Next we need to install composer. So Composer allows you to specify a set of libraries for a specific project then identifies the versions and dependencies and installs them.
