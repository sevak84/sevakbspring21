# Creating infrastructure on AWS console


I would like to share my experience in working on AWS console and create EC2 interface and S3 bucket. First I created EC2 on the AWS console as you can see the screenshot below.

Second step, I install Apache web server and update the index.html file to show my name on localhost which is connected to AWS and then add AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) to manage AWS services on my Ubuntu VM machine. There are three options you need to rememeber; An IAM role is an AWS identity and Access Management (IAM) entity with permissions to make AWS service requests. IAM roles cannot make direct requests to AWS services; they are meant to be assumed by authorized entities, such as IAM users, applications or AWS services such as EC2.

IAM Policies define permissions for an action regardless of the method that you use to perform the operation. For example, if a policy allows the ListBucket action, then a user/role with that policy can get
list buckets information from the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI or the AWS API. IAM Roles are defined as a set of permissions that grant access to actions and resources in AWS. A Policy is something that will be assigned to a role.

At the last step, we need to use AWS CLI with S3. So after running the command you will see your name on the Apache web server and in terminal the path and commands are appeared.
