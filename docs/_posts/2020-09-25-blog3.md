## In this lab exercise I learned how to create a dockerfile 

Docker file is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using docker build users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession. So on this labe I have learned to make a docker file

We need to build the docker at the first step so the command we need to run is: "docker build-t"

then create new container and run these commands below one by one in the terminal on ubuntu 18.04


RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade â€“y 
RUN apt-get install -y git
RUN apt-get install -y curl
RUN apt-get install -y apache2
