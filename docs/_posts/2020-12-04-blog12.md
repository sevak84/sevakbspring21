## Install Terraform on Ubuntu 18.04

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure automation tool created by HashiCorp. It's written in the Go programming language. It allows you to define and describe your infrastructure as code inside configuration files using a declarative language and to deploy and manage that infrastructure across a variety of public cloud providers like AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.


First, create ~/bin directory:

Command: mkdir ~/bin

On Ubuntu, if you create this directory it will automatically be added to your PATH.

Next, download the zip archive. Visit the Terraform download page for the latest version to download.


wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.12.24/terraform_0.11.11_linux_amd64.zip


Unzip the archive. The archive will extract a single binary called terraform.

unzip terraform_0.11.11_linux_amd64.zip


Move the terraform binary to a directory included in your system's PATH in our case that's ~/bin directory.


mv terraform ~/bin


To check whether Terraform is installed, run:

terraform version
### Terraform v0.11.11
