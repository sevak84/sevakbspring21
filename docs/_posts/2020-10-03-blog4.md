## Creating blog using Jekyll on Windows

### Prerequisites 

First of all we need to make sure the OS is up to date and have the latest updates from Microsoft. Then we need to install Visual Studio Code, GitHub for Windows and also a GitHub account. 

### Installing Jekyll 

To run Jekyll on Windows we need first download the Rubyinsaller for Windows then we have to make sure it is the most recent version and during installaion check the box that says "Run ‘ridk install’ to setup MSYS2 and development toolchain".

Once finished the installation wizard, we should see a command prompt to setup MSYS2 and the development toolchain. Simply enter 1 in the command prompt to install the MSYS2 base installation.

On the next step we should install the Jekyll bundler with this command on the command prompt 
"gem install jekyll bundler" 
Let’s confirm Jekyll is installed on Windows by outputting the version of Jekyll on our machine. To do this, run the command:
"jekyll -v"

Now we can create our blog using Jekyll. we can use one command to create a new blog with a default theme, post and page. Create a new folder on your PC for your Jekyll blog and use it’s full path as the parameter in the following command: "jekyll new PATH "

Open the Jekyll folder in Visual Studio Code and create a new terminal (Ctrl+). Now we can run the command to build and locally serve our Jekyll blog: "jekyll serve"

Once Jekyll has used the source files to build the website, we can now use the server address generated by Jekyll to view our new blog locally in the browser.

### Filename Structure

In the list of files that Jekyll creates using the jekyll new command there is a “_posts” folder. This is where Jekyll will look for blog posts when it builds our website.


### Front Matter 

It’s a simple way of adding information about the post or page to the top of the document. In the below front matter you will see:

   - The layout used for the document
   - The title of the document
   - The date the document was published
   - A list of categories the document belongs to

### Pages 

Let’s create a new GitHub repository so we can publish our new Jekyll blog on GitHub Pages. In your GitHub account, create the repository username.github.io, making sure username is the username of your GitHub account.

Now we need to clone the new repository to our PC using git through the command below
"git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io" 


Copy and paste all your Jekyll files into the new local repository on your PC and push your changes to the repository:

git add --all
git commit -m "Initial commit of Jekyll blog"
git push -u origin master

Done! We now be able to view your Jekyll blog at the address https://username.github.io.
