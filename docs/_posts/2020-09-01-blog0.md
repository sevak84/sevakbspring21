(CNN) says that; Russian, Chinese and Iranian hackers have all attempted to hack people and organizations involved in the 2020 US presidential election, Microsoft said on Thursday.
Thursday's disclosure sheds new light on efforts by Chinese and Iranian hackers to break into US political campaigns and suggests that Russian hacking efforts have continued apace.
"The activity we are announcing today makes clear that foreign activity groups have stepped up their efforts targeting the 2020 election," Microsoft said in a post on its website.
Top US cybersecurity officials acknowledged that Microsoft detected attempts to compromise email accounts of people and organizations associated with the presidential race but said there is no evidence election systems were affected.

"It is important to highlight that none are involved in maintaining or operating voting infrastructure and there was no identified impact on election systems," Chris Krebs, director of the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said in a statement to CNN Thursday.

Microsoft said the same Russian hacking group that was identified by US prosecutors as being primarily responsible for the attacks on the Democratic presidential campaign in 2016 had recently targeted national and state parties in the US and consultants who work for Republicans and Democrats. Microsoft said the Russians' tactics had evolved since 2016 and include likely automated "brute force" attacks.
The report said the Russian group had targeted more than 200 organizations, many, Microsoft said, "are directly or indirectly affiliated with the upcoming U.S. election as well as political and policy-related organizations in Europe."
