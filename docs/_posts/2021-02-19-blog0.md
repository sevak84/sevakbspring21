For the first blog I still havent anything special to add but I can put a brief introduction of what our group is planning to do as a project for this semester. 
The project's goal is to make and run an application on the live infrastructure on the web server like Amazon. 

For this reason we need to have a sample of what the application has to be. Then create EC2,VPC,Load balancer, on the AWS. 

Creating Githubrepository and make it public or private. 

Then we need to run Automation that includes 
 - Ansible
 - Terraform
 - Dockerfiles
 - CI/CD 
 - Scripts (power shell, python, etc)

we are suppos to build an API to be able run the web application that is hosted on the AWS.
